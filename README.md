# Akshada Bauskar — Data Science Portfolio  

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!  
This repository showcases my **end-to-end projects** in Machine Learning, Data Analysis, BI Dashboards, and Full-Stack Data Apps.  
It demonstrates my ability to work across the **entire data lifecycle** — from raw data ingestion and cleaning to modeling, visualization, and deployment.
